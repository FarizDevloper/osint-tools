Preamble
Most software licenses are designed to restrict your ability to share and modify the software. In contrast, the GNU General Public License (GPL) is intended to ensure that free software remains freely available to all users, enabling individuals and organizations to modify, enhance, and distribute the software. This GPL applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) software and any other software whose authors commit to using it.

When we refer to free software, we mean freedom (not necessarily price). The GNU General Public License aims to preserve your freedom to distribute copies of free software, modify it, and use it in any way you see fit. This license allows you to freely share and adapt the software, while simultaneously protecting its freedom and preventing proprietary encroachments.

This license is explicitly designed for projects like Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools — software that collects, processes, and analyzes publicly available data for security, research, and informational purposes. OSINT plays a critical role in both government and private-sector applications, helping users gather intelligence in a responsible, transparent, and legal manner.
